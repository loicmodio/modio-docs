The mod.io Unreal Engine plugin allows game developers to host and automatically install user-created mods in their games which use Unreal Engine 5. It provides a UI for mod discovery, installation and collection management, and a C++ and Blueprint interface around the mod.io SDK, which connects to the [mod.io REST API](https://docs.mod.io).

You can download the Unreal Engine plugin from the [mod.io GitHub Repository](https://github.com/modio/modio-ue) and follow the [installation guide](setup/) for installing and configuring the plugin.
