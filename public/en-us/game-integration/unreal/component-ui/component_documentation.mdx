Documentation for each component in the mod.io UI framework contains the following sections:

* **Component Requirements**  
  This section specifies any requirements that a Widget must meet in order to be considered a component by the mod.io UI. As the mod.io framework does not impose a specific base class on widgets, the primary requirements for each component will be specified in terms of the interfaces a widget should implement.

* **Default Implementation Notes**  
  This section contains a number of sub-sections providing information that is specific to the default implementation of a given component, provided by mod.io. These should be treated as implementation details from the perspective of widgets or components that consume the widget in question, but are relevant.

  **Properties**  
  This is a list of editable configuration properties that the default component implementation exposes. These properties are configurable on instances of the component, but runtime changes should be performed through the relevant interface instead.

  **Sub-components**  
  Some components may have sub-components (for example, the default button implementation provides a Label sub-component). This section outlines:
  
  - The getter function that's used to retrieve a reference to the sub-component in question.
  - The type or expected interfaces that the sub-component needs to implement.
  - A description of the sub-component.
  - How it is used in the default component implementation.

  **Events**  
  Components will expose interface functions for adding event handlers for various events that the component will emit. This section outlines what those events are and the data that is passed by the default implementation to delegates that are bound to those event handlers.
